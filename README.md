This version is an enhanced version of CloverGrower by STLVNUB. It's more suited
to Developers or Advanced Users.


Make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed. Won't work without it.

Unzip and run CloverGrower.sh, you only need to do this ONCE.
CloverGrowerPro will download all sources, GCC4.7.2, edk2 and Clover.
First build will take some time as it needs to compile GCC4.7.2, then it builds
edk2 BaseTools and then compiles Clover.

On subsequent uses you only need to open terminal and type "clover"
CloverGrowerPro will update any source files from edk2 or Clover and build you
a package.
